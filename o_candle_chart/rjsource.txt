the chart is based on apex chart library of react .

1. Step 
install apex chart library by npm i react-apexcharts
the styling of the apex chart is given by in the form of object in attributes called option and height width give as below

ex - <ReactApexChart options={options}  type="candlestick" height={"600px"} width={"1650px"}/>

var options = {
    chart: {
      type: "candlestick",
      height: 350,
    },
    xaxis: {
      type: "datetime",
    },
    yaxis: {
      tooltip: {
        enabled: true,
      },
    },
  };
  
  2. Step
  the data format support in apex chart is as follow . its also support var series array object of var data array of object 
  ex - <ReactApexChart series={series} options={options}  type="candlestick" height={"600px"} width={"1650px"}/>
  var series = [{ var data : [ x: time, y: [close, high, low, open] } , [ x: time, y: [close, high, low, open] }]]}]

  3. step 
  now fetch api and convert all the data to format of that apex support as explained in line no 27 .
  for live data you should call use effect again n again so put dependency array in which you are fetching the data 
 ex -
    const [stock, setStock] = useState([]);
    useEffect(() => {
    axios({
      method: "get",
      url: `https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines?symbol=${symbol}&interval=${time}&limit=100`,
    }).then((res) => {
      setStock(res.data);
    });
  }, [stock]);
as you can see i m fetching data in stock show i make stock as dependecy array so when the data will change in stock the use effect will called .
